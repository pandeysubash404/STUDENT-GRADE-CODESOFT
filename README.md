# Student Grade Calculator

For Java Development internship at CodeSoft

This is a comprehensive Java program that implements a Student Grade Calculator following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It allows you to calculate a student's total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade based on the marks obtained in different subjects.

## Features

- Calculate a student's total marks.
- Calculate the average percentage.
- Determine the corresponding grade based on the percentage.
- Supports subjects like Computer, English, Math, Nepali, and Science.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you'll need Java installed on your system.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Run the `StudentGradeMain.java` class to start the application.
